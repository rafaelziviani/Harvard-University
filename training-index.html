    <p>You can nest elements inside one another. When you first start a HTML file you type ! or html:5</p>

    <p><b>paragraph or p</b> and <b>h1, h2, h3...</b> are child elements of the body.</p>

    <p>In HTML some elements can have attributes, <br> and those attributes describe those elements.

    <p>To create a clickable link to navigate to some internet page, use the anchor attribute or <b>a href="URL"</b></p>

    <h1 class="learning-classes">Learning Classes and IDs</h1>

    <p class="learning-classes">Classes and IDs can be used inside any element, we use it to define elements, so we can
        select them in CSS and
        style them, we also use Classes and IDs in JavaScript when we want to do DOM manipulation.
        Classes and IDs are crucial for identifying elements
        IDs can be used only once. They have to be unique (don't use IDs tho. You're better using classes to style your
        page)
        Classes can be used over and over again.
        In CSS we use dash - to separate different words, in javascript we use camelCase cC



    <div id="your-name-div">
        <h4>GENERIC BOX DIV - DON'T USE</h4>
        <p>You can create a HTML box using a div, most generic one</p>

        <input type="text" placeholder="Write your name"> <button><b>
                <h3>Okdok<h3>
            </b></button>

        <p>a div has no meaning at all; the form is more semantic, it better describes the content that's inside
            of the box, when compared to the div.
            <"div"> tag is used to divide or section off content on a web page.
                <br>
                - content: text, images<br>
                - padding transparent area around the content, inside the box<br>
                - border: goes around the padding and the content<br>
                - margin: space between boxes<br>
                - fill area: area that gets filled with background color or background image
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <form id="your-name-form">
        <h1>Type ur name here</h1>
        <p>Fill in this form</p>

        <input type="text" placeholder="Type in your name"> <button>
            <h4><b>Okay!!!<b>
                        <h4>
        </button>

        <p>For the button to work you have to add some JS, also create a variable to store the value the user typed in.
        </p>
    </form>

        Wanna style something? Add a style tag above the title and select elements.
        We use CSS to style elements and create a layout for the page, styles can be created on the head using the style
        element, HEAD is for settings of the page and the style definitely counts as a setting.
        Usually we write CSS in an external .css file, just like we do with JS (.js) and then we link them in.
